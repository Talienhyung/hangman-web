Welcome to the rules of the Hangman game!

The rules are simple!

Objective of the game:
Your mission, if you accept it, is to guess the mystery word before you hang!

How it works :

A secret word will be chosen at random from those you've provided (argument file see --help). 

To put you on the right track, some letters of this secret word will be revealed. 

Your Super Power:
You have the power to suggest letters. You can suggest 10 different letters. When you suggest a valid letter, all the corresponding letters in the secret word will be revealed. 

But be careful, every mistake will bring you closer to the hanged man! If you're brave enough to propose a complete word and it's not the right one, you'll lose two chances. Don't play too close to the fire - you could get burned!
