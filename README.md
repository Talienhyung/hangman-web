Immediately after completing the above steps, you will be offered 3 levels. At the end of each game you can choose a level for the next game.

##### Easy

The easy level, by its name, is the simplest. If you win a game in easy, one point will be added to your score.

##### Medium

For the medium level, you'll be provided with a slightly more complicated word than the easy mode, which will earn you two points! Provided you guess it correctly, of course!

##### Hard

Harder words are on offer for this level! A word found will earn you three points!

#### 2. Score / BestScore

![Profile](./Ressources/ReadmeImg/Stat.png)

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see a score and a bestscore! "Score" is your current score, which increases with the number of words you find, but decreases to 0 if you lose even once! So if your current score exceeds your Bestscore, it replaces it!

#### 3. The Game
